Can attack:
+If not blocking
+If weapon is not on cooldown
+If recovered from being attacked
+If blocked and weapon which is not on cd used, counter-attack happens

Can block:
+If NO weapons are on cooldowns
+-If NOT recovered from being attacked, block has lesser chance to be successful (-x% OF current block chance)
-Attack and defence ratings must be compared to determine the chance of attack/block success. If atr is 2x bigger than dr, then attack has 100% success chance.

*Ataka nenublockinama, kuria galima numatyt
*Better AI
*Both basic attacks (right and left) at the same time result in a dash+knock, but decrease deff rating? Can be blocked and counter attacked. High risk, good reward, strong punishment for failing.

+If counter attack buff is present, it cannot be removed by any debuff.
