Can attack:
+If not blocking
+If weapon is not on cooldown
+If recovered from being attacked
-If blocked and weapon which is not on cd used, counter-attack happens

Can block:
+If NO weapons are on cooldowns
+-If NOT recovered from being attacked, block has lesser chance to be successful (-x% OF current block chance)
-Attack and defence ratings must be compared to determine the chance of attack/block success. If atr is 2x bigger than dr, then attack has 100% success chance.

-If attack is blocked, blocking gets turned off. (Probably too hardcore)
+-If counter attack buff is present, it cannot be removed by any debuff.


Attacks apply knock back? Only counter attacks apply knock back?
